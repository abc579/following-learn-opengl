* Graphics Programming
** OpenGL
*** What is OpenGL?
OpenGL is considered an API or specification that tells graphic driver developers (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel) what a function
should do and how it should behave.  Because of this, each implementation can be a little bit different, although the
function result has to be the same.

*** OpenGL Websites
API documentation: https://docs.gl/ Learn OpenGL: https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL

*** Core-profile vs. Immediate Mode
Immediate mode is the old way of doing things. Although OpenGL is easier to use with that mode, it's also very
inefficient.  For that reason, we use *Core-profile* mode. The latter offers more flexibility but it's harder.

*** State machine
OpenGL is a big state machine, which means that it always has a context. We can change or use this context by calling
OpenGL functions.

*** 3D space
Everything in OpenGL is in 3D space, but since screens are in 2D there exists a process that transforms 3D coordinates
to 2D. This is done in the [[Graphics Pipeline][Graphics Pipeline]].

*** Graphics Pipeline
It's a series of phases where two main events happen:

1) 3D coordinates are transformed into 2D. This is done at the "first part" of the pipeline.
2) 2D coordinates are transformed into colored pixels. This is done at the "second part" of the pipeline.

The pipeline is composed of different steps or phases, where each one requires as input the output of the previous phase
or step.  The great benefit of this pipeline is that we can parallelize it.  Because graphic cards have a lot of cores,
they can process our data quickly in programs that are called [[Shaders][shaders]].

Initially, we give the pipeline, as input, the [[Vertex Data][vertex data]].

#+CAPTION: Pipeline
#+NAME: Pipeline.png
[[./Pipeline.png]]

The blue background colored phases or steps are the ones where we can inject our own shaders.

Goal of each step:

1. *Vertex Shader*: transform 3D coordinates into "different" 3D coordinates. This shader also allows us to tinker with
   vertex attributes. These coordinates need to be [[Normalized Device Coordinates][normalized]]. Input variables within this shader are usually referred
   to as [[Vertex Attributes][vertex attributes]].
2. *Geometry Shader*: the output of the vertex shader is passed to this one. This shader can generate new shapes using the
   ones we gave it. In the image above, we can see that it creates a second triangle. This shader is _optional_.
3. *Shape Assembly*: the output of the geometry shader or vertex is passed to this one. It takes these vertices or vertex
   (depending on the [[Primitives][primitive]] selected) and assembles all the points.
4. *Rasterization*: takes the output of the shape assembly as input and maps the _resulting primitives_ to actual pixels on
   the screen. The result is called [[Fragment][fragments]], and they're passed to the fragment shader. Before they're passed,
   [[Clipping][clipping]] is performed.
5. *Fragment Shader*: takes fragments as input and its goal is to compute the color for each one of the pixels. In this
   step is where all the magic effects happen.
6. *Tests and Blending*: after the color is determined for each pixel, two more events happen, [[Alpha Test][alpha test]] and
   [[Blending][blending]]. Both can be summarized as a process where opacity and blending of different objects are computed.

In modern OpenGL, we are *required* to define at least one vertex and fragment shader, otherwise the program won't run
correctly.

*** Shaders
They're basically programs that run in the GPU. They need to be created, compiled and when we link them together they
produce a [[Shader Program][shader program]].  Since we need to create shaders, we also need to _delete them_.

A shader typically has the following structure:

#+NAME: Typical shader program
#+BEGIN_SRC glsl
  #version version_number
  in type in_variable_name;
  in type in_variable_name;

  out type out_variable_name;

  uniform type uniform_name;

  void main() {
    // process input and do something...

    // output processed stuff to output variable
    out_variable_name = weird_stuff_processed;
  }
#+END_SRC

We can pass data between shaders (contiguous) if input and output variables have the same name and type. When we link the shaders
together, OpenGL will take care of that.

*** Shader Program
Linked version of multiple shaders combined.  To create a shader program, first, we need to create a program, then
attach the corresponding shaders and finally link them:

#+NAME: Example of creation of shader program.
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
  unsigned int shaderProgram;
  shaderProgram = glCreateProgram();
  glAttachShader(shaderProgram, vertexShader);
  glAttachShader(shaderProgram, fragmentShader);
  glLinkProgram(shaderProgram);
#+END_SRC

To use it, we call the glUseProgram() function.

*** Vertex Data
It's an array of 3D coordinates (vertices) that should form a triangle.

*** Vertex Format
It refers to all the information (layout of data) associated with each vertex in an 3D object.
It encompasses all the attributes that define a vertex.

*** Vertex Attributes
They are the individual properties of a particular vertex. A vertex can have different properties, for example, its
color and position. We can add more attributes or properties to a vertex.

We have to manually tell OpenGL what's the size in bytes of the information to a particular vertex.

#+CAPTION: Vertex Attributes and Data Example
#+NAME: VertexAttributesAndData.png
[[./VertexAttributesAndData.png]]

In this example:

- Each coordinate is a float (4 bytes, 32 bits).
- Each coordinate has three components: X, Y and Z.
- Values are _tighly packed_.

To inform OpenGL about this, we use the function glVertexAttribPointer.

*** Primitives
Hints we give to OpenGL to tell it how we want to draw our [[Vertex Data][vertex data]].  Some of these hints are:

1. GL_POINTS.
2. GL_TRIANGLES.
3. GL_LINE_STRIP.

*** Clipping
Process that ignores parts or sections of shapes that are not going to be rendered on the screen.  For example, if we're
looking forward, and we have a very extensive image in front of us, clipping will be performed on left and right,
because we can't see it completely.  This process improves performance.

*** Fragment
It's all the data required to render a single pixel on the screen.

*** Alpha Test
Process where object's opacity is determined.

*** Blending
Process where OpenGL determines if one object is in front of another (for example) and blends them accordingly.

*** Normalized Device Coordinates
X, Y and Z coordinates that range from [-1.0, 1.0].

*** Vertex Buffer Object (VBO)
It's a chunk of memory that we use store all the vertices of a particular object. It can contain information such as
position, color, normals, etc.

When we use VBOs we also have to tell OpenGL how we want the GPU to interpret the data that's inside, among other things.

Its buffer type is _GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_.

*** GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)
Programming language used to program shaders in OpenGL.

*** Vectors in GLSL
In GLSL, a vector is composed of 4 components: x, y, z and w. W represents something called _perspective division_.

*** Perspective division
TODO

*** Vertex Array Object (VAO)
It's a container or a manager that stores all the state-related settings needed to render a particular object.

In other words, it stores the current bound [[Vertex Buffer Object][VBO]] for us to use it later.

This is very useful to save us from writing a lot of code, because when we want to draw something to the screen we need
to do a series of steps.

The workflow would look like this:

1) Set up the vertex data, i.e, define vertices for a triangle.
2) Set up the vertex format, i.e, define the layout of the vertex attributes.
3) Create and bind a VAO, that way we save the current context.
4) Link the VAO to the VBO.
5) Render the triangle using the VAO.

We can reuse VAOs (_shared VAOS_) if multiple objects have the same vertex format and rendering settings. However, if
objects need to have, say, different shaders, then we'd need to use more than one VAO.

_Modern OpenGL requires to use at least one VAO._

*** Element Buffer Object (EBO)
They're buffers that store the order (_indices_) in which we want vertices to be drawn.

When we use this approach to draw things, we're doing [[Indexed Drawing][indexed drawing]]. Indices start from 0.

We also need to bind them, just like [[Vertex Buffer Object][VBOs]], however, the main difference is that we'll use GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER when
binding, and then we'll use glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays.

[[Vertex Array Object (VAO)][VAOs]] also store EBOs.

NOTE:

A VAO stores the glBindBuffer calls when the target is GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER. This also means it stores its unbind
calls so make sure you don't unbind the element array buffer before unbinding your VAO, otherwise it doesn't have an EBO
configured.

*** Indexed Drawing
TODO

*** Wireframe Mode
It's a mode that draws only the edges of triangles.

*** Uniforms
Are global variables that live within shaders. They're useful when we need to change something -like a color- every
frame or to pass information between shaders, since they're shared among all shaders that are linked together.

The syntax is:

#+NAME: Example of uniform variable
#+BEGIN_SRC glsl
  uniform vec4 myColor;
#+END_SRC

The way we initialize the uniform from our program/application (and also our CPU) is by invoking the function
glUniform4f (or similar ones):

#+NAME: Example of uniform variable
#+BEGIN_SRC glsl
  int vertexColorLocation = glGetUniformLocation(shaderProgram, "ourColor");
  glUseProgram(shaderProgram);
  glUniform4f(vertexColorLocation, 0.0f, greenValue, 0.0f, 1.0f);
#+END_SRC

_NOTE_:

If you declare a uniform that isn't used anywhere in your GLSL code the compiler will silently remove the variable from
the compiled version which is the cause for several frustrating errors; keep this in mind!

** Render Loop
The render loop is the main loop of the program where we _typically_ do 3 things: *process keyboard input*, *render stuff* and
finally *draw to the screen*.  Statements executed within this loop are said to be executed in _one frame_.  Because of
this, it's important for functions within this section to be as fast as possible.
** GLSL
It's the language that we use to write shaders. Similar to C.

It contains useful features to work with vectors and matrices.

Types supported:

- uint
- int
- float
- double
- bool

Containers available:

- vectors (n represents the number of components, [2, 4])
  Components are: x, y, z and w.

  Type of vectors:

  - vecn (floats)
  - bvecn (boolean)
  - ivecn (integers)
  - uvecn (unsigned integers)
  - dvecn (double)

- matrices

*** Swizzling
It's a syntax feature of GLSL that allows us to create vectors in a fancy way.

For example:

#+NAME: Typical shader program
#+BEGIN_SRC glsl
  void main() {
    vec2 someVec;
    vec4 differentVec = someVec.xyxx;
    vec3 anotherVec = differentVec.zyw;
    vec4 otherVec = someVec.xxxx + anotherVec.yxzy;
  }
#+END_SRC

** Interpolation
Imagine we had a right triangle with three vertices.

Each vertex has a different color, for example, red, green and blue.

Now, within the triangle there are a lot of fragments or pixels that are in-between these vertices, and because a change
of color need to happen as we approach to one of the vertices, OpenGL computes a mix of colors with a smooth transition
for each fragment. That process is called interpolation.

For example, if we look from the red vertex to the green one, we'd see the color yellow exactly in the middle of the
trajectory. As we approach the green vertex, the color will smoothly be converting to green.
