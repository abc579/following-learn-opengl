# Core-profile and Immediate Mode

## Immediate-Mode (fixed function pipeline)

Old way of OpenGL programming. Less control. Inneficient.

## Core-profile Mode

New way. More flexible.

# State Machine

The state of OpenGL is called the context. We change the context manipulating buffers.

# IDs

We create objects and store their IDs to manipulate them later on.

# Frame

Each iteration inside the render loop is called a frame.
